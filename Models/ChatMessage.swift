// The ChatMessage struct should now only exist in Models/ChatModels.swift
// If this file contains other models, leave them, but remove the ChatMessage struct definition.
// For now, I will assume this file should be emptied or deleted.
// This file should be empty or deleted since ChatMessage is now in ChatModels.swift
